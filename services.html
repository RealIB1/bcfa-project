            Let's start with some quick definitions. Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things). Bitcoin is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented.
A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, such as the Ghana cedi, but is digital and uses encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds.
 
Financial institutions are exploring how they could also use blockchain technology to upend everything from clearing and settlement to insurance and our foundation is the open-source of knowledge on all things crypto.
         We examine the potential benefits of your innovationsâ€”and also suggest a way forward for institutions and investors alike from our streams of providing awareness to your brand.

            We also provide an overview of how regulators are thinking about cryptocurrency in financial services in Ghana and other developing African countries.</article>
